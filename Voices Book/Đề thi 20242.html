                    <h5>New TV Star: Jeanne Dixon</h5>
                    <p>Jeanne Dixon began making predictions when she was a little girl. She had a crystal ball that she used to look into the future. She correctly predicted several events, including the death of her grandfather. She also learned to use astrology. When she was just eight years old, a palm reader told her fortune. The palm reader said that Jeanne would become famous for her unique ability to predict the future.</p>
                    <p>Dixon made many predictions about the future throughout her life, but the one that brought her the most fame was her prediction of the assassination of President Kennedy. In 1952, she had a vision. She saw a man with blue eyes living in the White House. He was going to die a violent death. Eight years later, John Kennedy, a man with blue eyes, became president of the United States. On November 22<sup>nd</sup>, 1963, Jeanne told her friends, "Something terrible is going to happen today." Then, they heard an announcement. President Kennedy had been shot.</p>
                    <p>Another of Dixon's major predictions was the death of President Kennedy's brother Robert. One day, she was walking through a hotel in Los Angeles. Suddenly, she stopped and said, "Robert Kennedy is going to be killed here." Soon after that, in June 1968, Robert Kennedy was shot in that exact place.</p>
                    <p>Dixon accurately predicted the deaths of several other celebrities. She also predicted other kinds of events, for example, a big earthquake in Alaska in 1964. She made a number of wrong predictions as well, but people don't seem to remember as many of these. </p>
                    <p>Dixon didn't keep any fees she earned from making predictions. She donated all the money to a charity that supported educational and health projects for children. She was a vegetarian and often prepared healthy food for elderly people. She also liked to help animals and took care of many lost cats and dogs.</p>
                    <p>Jeanne Dixon died in 1997, but she left behind several predictions which could still come true. One of them is that intelligent life will be discovered on another planet.</p>

                <h4>Bài viết mẫu: Your Favorite Movie</h4>
                <p>My favorite movie is **Spirited Away**, a beautiful animated film by Studio Ghibli. The story follows a young girl named Chihiro who wanders into a magical world and must work in a bathhouse for spirits to save her parents, who have been turned into pigs. It’s a captivating journey about courage, self-discovery, and friendship.</p>
                <p>I first watched this movie when I was about ten years old, and it immediately enchanted me with its unique characters and stunning visuals. It left a profound impression on me, making me believe in the power of imagination.</p>
                <p>It's my favorite because it blends fantasy with deep themes about identity and growing up. The animation is breathtaking, and the music is truly magical. Every time I watch it, I discover something new, and it always makes me feel a sense of wonder and warmth. It's not just a movie; it's an experience that stays with you.</p>

However, none of the provided options are relative pronouns. If forced to choose from these options, 'however' (tuy nhiên) could be used as a conjunctive adverb to indicate contrast or transition, but it requires a different sentence structure (e.g., a semicolon or full stop before it).
